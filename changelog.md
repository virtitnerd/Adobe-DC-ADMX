# Changelog

Settings changes across ADMX versions. Only new, renamed, or reclassified settings are listed — internal script and formatting changes are omitted.

---

## v3.4 — 29 June 2026

**New category: Browser Extension.** Adds 12 policies for the Adobe Acrobat browser extension (Chrome and Edge), configured through each browser's own managed-storage policy mechanism rather than Adobe's `FeatureLockDown` namespace. These control the extension itself, not whether it's installed — installation remains controlled by the browser's own `ExtensionInstallForcelist`/`ExtensionInstallBlocklist` policies.

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open Help Tab on Install (Chrome / Edge) | `OpenHelpx` | N/A | String `"true"`/`"false"` |
| Usage Analytics (Chrome / Edge) | `UsageMeasurement` | N/A | String `"true"`/`"false"` |
| Uninstall Popup for Free Users (Chrome / Edge) | `UninstallPopup` | N/A | String `"true"`/`"false"` |
| Disable GenAI Features (Chrome / Edge) | `DisableGenAI` | N/A | String `"true"`/`"false"` |
| Disable What's New Auto-Open (Chrome / Edge) | `DisableWhatsNewAutoOpen` | N/A | String `"true"`/`"false"` |
| Disable Express Features (Chrome / Edge) | `DisableExpress` | N/A | String `"true"`/`"false"` |

Sourced from the extension's own `schema.json` (package ID `efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj` on Chrome,
mirrored on Edge as `elhekieabhbkpmcefcoobjddigjcaadp`). New documentation page:
[Browser Extension Settings](browser-extension.md).

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 576 Machine + 501 User = 1,077 |

---

## v3.3 — 29 June 2026

**New machine policy (Reader + Acrobat):** A legacy usage-data master switch, retained for environments that still rely on it even though Adobe has superseded it for most purposes.

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send Usage Data to Adobe | `bUsageMeasurement` | N/A | Disabled → DWORD **0** |

**New user policy:** A free-text companion to the existing **URL Access Permissions** policy.

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trusted/Blocked URL List | `tHostPerms` | N/A | Text value, only effective when iURLPerms = Custom Setting (0) |

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 564 Machine + 501 User = 1,065 |

---

## v3.2 — 28 June 2026

**New user policies:** Two **Security: Trust & Permissions** policies covering certificate auto-download, previously only configurable via direct registry write. Both target the same non-Policy `HKCU` paths used by Adobe's own ADM template.

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Load Security Settings from Server (Adobe Certificates) | `bLoadSettingsFromURL` | N/A | Disabled → DWORD **0** |
| Load Security Settings from Server (European Certificates) | `bLoadSettingsFromURL` | N/A | Disabled → DWORD **0** |

**Scope correction:** `iURLPerms` (default website access policy) is a User-scope preference under `TrustManager\cDefaultLaunchURLPerms`, not a Computer-scope `FeatureLockDown` control. Some DISA STIG documents list it incorrectly as Computer-scope; the existing **URL Access Permissions** policy under *User Configuration* is the correct ADMX mapping.

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 560 Machine + 499 User = 1,059 |

---

## v3.1 — 28 June 2026

**New machine policies (Reader + Acrobat):** Two settings required by DISA STIG that were missing from the template. Both are deprecated in DC 12.x and later in favor of their Document Cloud replacements, but Acrobat still honors the underlying registry values.

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Disable Acrobat.com File Storage | `bDisableADCFileStore` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** |
| Welcome Screen on Startup | `bShowWelcomeScreen` | N/A | Disabled → DWORD **0** |

Also rewrote the `_Explain` text for all DISA STIG-relevant policies for clarity, matching Adobe's own ADML prose style, and added two new documentation pages mapping every DISA STIG control to its ADMX policy name and registry path: [STIG: Acrobat Pro DC Continuous](stig-acrobat-pro-dc.md) and [STIG: Acrobat Reader DC Continuous](stig-acrobat-reader-dc.md).

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 560 Machine + 495 User = 1,055 |

---

## v3.0 — 28 June 2026

Major version bump (v2.x → v3.0): merging the Machine and User templates into one file is a structural break from every prior version, which shipped them as separate ADMX pairs.

**Unified Machine + User template:** `AdobeDC.admx` and `AdobeDC.adml` now contain both the machine-scope policies and the user-scope policies (previously shipped separately as **User ADMX v1.6**) in a single ADMX+ADML pair. This drops the number of custom ADMX uploads required in Intune from 2 to 1. The per-architecture `AdobeDC_x64.admx`/`AdobeDC_x86.admx` files have been retired in favor of one combined file covering every architecture and both Computer and User scope.

**Breaking change:** User-scope policies were previously marked `class="Both"`, causing all 495 of them to appear incorrectly under *Computer Configuration* as well as *User Configuration*. They are now correctly marked `class="User"` and appear only under *User Configuration*.

**Registry path corrections:**

| Setting scope | Old path | New path | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reader DC x64 (123 machine policies) | `SOFTWARE\...\Acrobat Reader\DC\...` | `SOFTWARE\...\Adobe Acrobat\DC\...` | The Unified Installer's 64-bit Reader shares Acrobat's registry hive; the legacy Reader hive is only used by 32-bit Reader. |
| Adobe ARM (6 machine policies) | `SOFTWARE\Adobe\Adobe ARM\...` | `SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Adobe\Adobe ARM\...` | Adobe ARM is always a 32-bit process, even on x64 deployments. |

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 552 Machine + 495 User = 1,047 |

---

## v2.19 — 28 June 2026

**New machine policies (Reader + Acrobat):** Six **Microsoft Purview (MIP)** lockdown policies under `FeatureLockDown`, completing the HKLM portion of [issue #8](https://github.com/systmworks/Adobe-DC-ADMX/issues/8). These are admin lockdown policies (they gray out or lock Preferences UI); they complement the per-user `MicrosoftAIP` preferences in [User ADMX v1.6](https://github.com/systmworks/Adobe-DC-User-ADMX).

Registry values are sourced from [Adobe enterprise MIP guidance](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/kb/mpip-support-acrobat.html) (community-verified; not in the official PrefRef lockable table).

*Thanks to **[@virtitnerd](https://github.com/virtitnerd)** for the original feature request.*

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enable MIP Labelling | `bMIPLabelling` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** |
| Check MIP Policy on Save | `bMIPCheckPolicyOnDocSave` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** |
| MIP Sovereign Cloud | `iMIPCloud` | N/A | Dropdown (0–10; Commercial = **3**) |
| MIP External Browser Auth | `bMIPExternalAuthAdmin` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** |
| MIP Double Key Encryption | `bEnableDKEAdmin` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** |
| Suppress OS Auth Prompts (MIP) | `bSilentAuth` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** (Disabled → **0** for auth troubleshooting) |

Per-user HKCU policies (`bShowDMB`, `bEnablePolicyAuthentication`, `bEnableLogging`) ship in **User ADMX v1.6** only. Computer and User templates use separate namespaces (`Adobe.Policies.AdobeDC` vs `Adobe.Policies.Adobe_User`) and can be deployed together.

See [readme in v2.19](../v2.19/readme.md) (includes **v2.18** release notes in the same file).

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 552 |
| `AdobeDC_x64.admx` / `AdobeDC_x86.admx` | 276 each |

---

## v2.18 — 20 May 2026

**New machine policy (Reader + Acrobat):** **Block non-PDF file attachments** (`iFileAttachmentPerms`, DWORD **1** under `FeatureLockDown`), per DISA STIG Reader **V-213174** (ARDC-CN-000035) and Acrobat Pro **V-213119** (AADC-CN-000275), and consistent with NSA hardening guidance for Adobe Acrobat.

*Thanks to **CyberChelonian** for flagging this setting.*

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block non-PDF file attachments | `iFileAttachmentPerms` | N/A | Enabled → DWORD **1** (Not configured = product default; Disabled → DWORD **0**) |

See [readme in v2.18](../v2.18/readme.md) (includes **v2.17** release notes in the same file; version readmes do not link across folders).

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 528 |
| `AdobeDC_x64.admx` / `AdobeDC_x86.admx` | 264 each |

---

## v2.17 — 19 May 2026

**New Acrobat DC policies (machine):** **Protected Mode Sandbox** (`bProtectedMode`) and **AppContainer Sandbox** (`bEnableProtectedModeAppContainer`) under `FeatureLockDown`, aligned with Adobe's [Privileged (Protected Mode)](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/PrefRef/Windows/Privileged.html) reference and DISA STIG Acrobat Pro DC **V-213127** (AADC-CN-001010). They were previously available in the templates under **Reader DC** only; they now appear under **Acrobat DC** as well so administrators can enforce sandbox settings on full Acrobat through Group Policy or Intune.

*Thanks to **CyberChelonian** for flagging the need for Acrobat DC coverage of these sandbox settings.*

| Setting | ValueName | Old version | New version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protected Mode Sandbox | `bProtectedMode` | N/A | New for **Acrobat DC**; Enabled → DWORD **1** |
| AppContainer Sandbox | `bEnableProtectedModeAppContainer` | N/A | New for **Acrobat DC**; Enabled → DWORD **1** |

See [readme in v2.17](../v2.17/readme.md) (includes **v2.16** release notes in the same file; version readmes do not link across folders).

| ADMX File | Policies |
|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | 524 |
| `AdobeDC_x64.admx` / `AdobeDC_x86.admx` | 262 each |

---

## v2.16 — 28 April 2026

**No settings changes:** Policy definitions are unchanged from **v2.15** below; this drop updates ADMX/ADML-only metadata (`revision`/`minRequiredRevision` alignment and three-line localization root element layout for Group Policy interoperability). Omitted per the rule above; see [readme in v2.16](../v2.16/readme.md).

---

## v2.15 — 16 April 2026

**Breaking change:** Corrected Enabled/Disabled toggle mapping for three policies where "Enabled" in Group Policy wrote the wrong DWORD value.

| Setting | ValueName | v2.14 (old) | v2.15 (new) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block JavaScript Execution | `bDisableJavaScript` | Enabled → DWORD 0 (allow) | Enabled → DWORD 1 (block) |
| Disable SharePoint & Office 365 Integration | `bDisableSharePointFeatures` | Enabled → DWORD 0 (enable) | Enabled → DWORD 1 (disable) |
| Disable WebMail Integration | `bDisableWebmail` | Enabled → DWORD 0 (enable) | Enabled → DWORD 1 (disable) |

**If you previously deployed these policies, verify and re-apply the intended state after upgrading.**

### FriendlyName corrections

| ValueName | Old FriendlyName | New FriendlyName |
|---|---|---|
| `bDisableSharePointFeatures` | SharePoint & Office 365 Integration | Disable SharePoint & Office 365 Integration |
| `bDisableWebmail` | WebMail Integration | Disable WebMail Integration |

The old names were misleading because selecting "Enabled" in Group Policy actually disabled the feature. The new names make the admin intent clear.

### Summary text improvements

Four policies reworded from "Disables X" to "Controls whether X is enabled" for neutral, descriptive text:

| ValueName | FriendlyName |
|---|---|
| `bToggleAdobeDocumentServices` | Document Cloud Services |
| `bTogglePrefsSync` | Preferences Synchronization |
| `bUpdater` (cServices) | Services & Web-Plugin Updates |
| `bToggleAdobeSign` | Adobe Acrobat Sign |

### DISA STIG cross-references

Policy description text now includes DISA STIG rule references where applicable (20 registry settings; 26 Reader rules, 23 Pro rules).

### Documentation updates

- **Security Hardening page:** 10 new entries added (5 Recommended, 5 Optional) for settings that had GoodSetting recommendations but were not previously listed.
- **Reduce Nags page:** 2 new entries added; existing Product Updater entry corrected to reference the FeatureLockDown path.

### Combined ADMX file

A new combined ADMX file (`AdobeDC.admx`) is now provided alongside the existing per-architecture files.

| ADMX File | Products & Architectures | Policies |
|---|---|---:|
| `AdobeDC.admx` | Reader DC (x86 + x64) and Acrobat DC (x86 + x64) | 520 |
| `AdobeDC_x64.admx` | Reader DC (x64) and Acrobat DC (x64) | 260 |
| `AdobeDC_x86.admx` | Reader DC (x86) and Acrobat DC (x86) | 260 |

Policy count unchanged from v2.14.

---

## v2.13 — 14 April 2026

Two settings added for both products, bringing the total to **262 policies** (144 Acrobat + 118 Reader).

| Setting | ValueName | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Block JavaScript Execution | `bDisableJavaScript` | New — Both products. Blocks and locks JavaScript execution; prevents users from bypassing via privileged locations. Added to **Security Hardening** page as Recommended (Enabled). |
| Accept EULA for Updater | `EULA` | New — Both products. Accepts the EULA on behalf of the user so the built-in updater can download product updates. |

`bDisableJavaScript` was present in all v1.x ADMX versions but was inadvertently omitted when the v2.x series was generated from the lockable PrefRef CSV. The v1.3 ADMX had the enabledValue/disabledValue wired backwards (Enabled=0=allow); v2.13 corrects this to match the `bDisablePDFRedirectionActions` pattern (Enabled=1=block). `EULA` is a non-policy HKLM key under `AdobeViewer` that was present in v1.3 but dropped in v2.x; it has been re-added as an enterprise convenience for deployments that did not set `EULA_ACCEPT=YES` at install time.

---

## v2.12 — 13 April 2026

**Breaking change:** Corrected the GPO Enabled/Disabled toggle mapping for two Acrobat DC policies.

| Setting | ValueName | v2.11 (old) | v2.12 (new) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block EMF to PDF Conversion | `BlockEMFParsing` | Enabled → DWORD 0 (allow) | Enabled → DWORD 1 (block) |
| Block XPS to PDF Conversion | `BlockXPSParsing` | Enabled → DWORD 0 (allow) | Enabled → DWORD 1 (block) |

In v2.11, setting these policies to **Enabled** wrote DWORD 0 (allow conversion), contradicting the "Block..." friendly name. v2.12 aligns the toggle so **Enabled = block** and **Disabled = allow**, matching both the policy name and Adobe's documented registry semantics.

**If you previously deployed these policies, verify and re-apply the intended state after upgrading.**

Also updated the ADML Explain text to include a GPO-oriented clarification for both policies.

Documentation: `bAcroSuppressUpsell` (Show Upgrade Prompts) scope corrected from Reader to Both on the **Reduce Nags** page — the Unified x64 installer reads Acrobat registry keys, so this setting must be configurable under Acrobat DC.

---

## v2.11 — 13 April 2026

Existing setting expanded to Acrobat DC, bringing the total to **258 policies** (142 Acrobat + 116 Reader).

| Setting | ValueName | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Hide Adobe Messages on Document Open | `bDontShowMsgWhenViewingDoc` | Expanded from Reader DC only to Both (Reader + Acrobat). The Unified x64 installer runs in Reader mode under Acrobat registry keys, so this setting must be configurable under the Acrobat DC path for Unified deployments. |

Also updated the **Reduce Nags** documentation page scope from Reader to Both.

Resolved **Known Issue** from v2.10: "`cIPM\bDontShowMsgWhenViewingDoc` evaluate adding an Acrobat DC entry" — now included.

---

## v2.10 — 13 April 2026

One new setting added for both products, bringing the total to **257 policies** (141 Acrobat + 116 Reader).

| Setting | ValueName | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Patch Cache Cleanup | `PatchCleanFlag` | New — Both products; sourced from [Adobe Employee response on Adobe Community (Feb 2026)](https://community.adobe.com/questions-9/we-have-a-few-computers-wtih-literally-hundreds-of-1gb-update-msi-files-downloading-constantly-1302886). Not listed on lockable.html or PrefRef. |

Also added to the **Reduce Nags** documentation page as a Recommended setting (Enabled).

---

## v2.9 — 11 April 2026

One new Acrobat-only setting added and one FriendlyName renamed, bringing the total to **255 policies** (140 Acrobat + 115 Reader).

| Setting | ValueName | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Reader mode on Acrobat (Unified x64) | `bIsSCReducedModeEnforcedEx` | New — Acrobat DC only; sourced from [Adobe enterprise KB](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/kb/acrobat-64-bit-for-enterprises.html) |
| Generative AI Technology | `bEnableGentech` | FriendlyName renamed from "Enable Generative AI" |

[**MHimken**](https://www.reddit.com/user/MHimken/) flagged that the Windows ADMX is not required; the unused `<using namespace="Microsoft.Policies.Windows" prefix="windows"/>` line was removed from generated ADMX `policyNamespaces`.

---

## v2.8 — 10 April 2026

Three new settings added from Adobe's Application Security Guide, bringing the total to **254 policies** (139 Acrobat + 115 Reader).

| Setting | ValueName | Type | Category | Hardening |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3D Content in PDFs | `bEnable3D` | DWORD toggle | Security: Execution & Protection | Recommended — Disabled |
| Unlisted Attachment Type Permissions | `iUnlistedAttachmentTypePerm` | 4-value dropdown | Security: Execution & Protection | Recommended — Prompt without ability to allow |
| Built-in Attachment Permissions List | `tBuiltInPermList` | Text (pipe-separated list) | Security: Execution & Protection | Not on hardening page |

---

## v2.7 — 9 April 2026

One new setting added; five existing cloud connector settings moved from Reduce Nags to Security Hardening page as Recommended.

| Setting | ValueName | Change |
|---|---|---|
| OneDrive Connector | `bOneDriveConnectorEnabled` | New setting — Recommended Disabled on hardening page |
| Third-Party Cloud Connectors | `bToggleWebConnectors` | Moved to hardening page — Recommended Disabled |
| Box Cloud Connector | `bBoxConnectorEnabled` | Moved to hardening page — Recommended Disabled |
| Dropbox Cloud Connector | `bDropboxConnectorEnabled` | Moved to hardening page — Recommended Disabled |
| Google Drive Connector | `bGoogleDriveConnectorEnabled` | Moved to hardening page — Recommended Disabled |

Total: **248 policies** (136 Acrobat + 112 Reader).

---

## v2.5 — 8 April 2026

No new settings. Acrobat DC x86 policies added to `AdobeDC_x86.admx` (previously Reader-only). Total x64 policy count: **248**.

---

## v2.2 — 8 April 2026

No new settings. 15 FriendlyNames corrected to fix double-negative logic, and 6 clarified for consistency. Registry values and toggle logic unchanged.

### Double-negative fixes (15 settings)
