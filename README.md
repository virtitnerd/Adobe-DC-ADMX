# Adobe DC ADMX/ADML Documentation

Detailed policy reference pages, changelogs, and curated guides live under [Documentation/](Documentation/).

> [!WARNING]
> **Migrating from v2.x or User ADMX v1.x is a breaking change.** The combined namespace and re-organised tree mean **Intune ADMX backups/exports from those versions will not import into v3.5**.
>
> Convert them first with [`Helper_Scripts/Convert-AdobeDcIntuneExportToCombinedV3.ps1`](Helper_Scripts/Convert-AdobeDcIntuneExportToCombinedV3.ps1), then re-import.
>
> See the [ADMX install guide](ADMX/readme.md) for migration steps. Upgrading from combined v3.0/v3.1/v3.2/v3.3/v3.4 to v3.5 keeps the same namespace and policy names for existing settings. **v3.4+ releases are additive-only** except where a changelog entry documents a one-time control-type correction - re-upload preserves existing Intune/GPO bindings for all other settings.

These ADMX/ADML templates (v3.5) provide Group Policy and Intune management of Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Reader DC on Windows. A single `AdobeDC.admx`/ADML pair covers machine-level (`HKLM`) and user-level (`HKCU`) policies.

## Important Notes

| ![Note](https://img.shields.io/badge/Note-316dca?style=flat-square) |
|------|
| x64 Reader (Unified Installer) is configured under **Acrobat & Reader DC** (Acrobat hive), not the Reader hive. Configure legacy 32-bit Reader under **Reader DC (32-bit)**. |
| Some machine settings write outside `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies` and appear under **Adobe DC > Non-Policy Settings** with architecture-specific sub-nodes (**Acrobat & Reader DC (64-bit)**, **Acrobat DC (32-bit)**, **Reader DC (32-bit)**). See curated guides for marked entries. |
| Browser extension settings write to each browser's 3rdparty extension policy path under **Adobe DC > Browser Extensions** (Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge). Values are REG_SZ strings, not DWORD. See [Browser Extension Settings](Documentation/browser-extension.md). |
| Several ``bToggle*`` policies use inverted registry values (DWORD 0 = feature ON, DWORD 1 = feature OFF). |

## Category Overview (Device)

> Counts are product-scoped: settings that apply to both Reader and Acrobat are listed under each product, so Reader + Acrobat column totals are higher than the number of unique settings. The ADMX contains **319** machine policy entries (**155** unique machine settings after removing non-ADMX `tBuiltInPermList`; architecture-specific non-policy settings are emitted separately for x64 and x86). Overall template: **319** machine + **515** user = **834** policy entries.
