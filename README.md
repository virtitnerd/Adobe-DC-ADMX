These ADMX/ADML templates (v3.4) provide Group Policy and Intune management of Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Reader DC on Windows, plus the Adobe Acrobat browser extension for Chrome and Edge. They define both machine-level (`HKLM`) and user-level (`HKCU`) policies covering cloud connectors, security hardening, trust and permissions, UI experience, updates, upsell controls, and browser extension behavior.

The full policy set now ships as a single **combined** ``AdobeDC.admx``/ADML pair, covering Reader DC and Acrobat DC across both x86 and x64, plus all user-level policies:

|------|-------|----------|
| `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML | Reader DC (x86 + x64), Acrobat DC (x86 + x64), and the Chrome/Edge browser extension, Computer and User scope | 576 Machine + 501 User = 1,077 |

Deploy the one combined file — it covers every architecture, both products, and both Computer and User Configuration.

## Important Notes

| ![Note](https://img.shields.io/badge/Note-316dca?style=flat-square) |
|------|
| Acrobat Reader (x64) using the new **Unified Installer** runs ``Acrobat.exe``, so it requires configuration of the **Acrobat** settings rather than the Reader settings. To be safe, configure both. 32-bit Reader still uses its own legacy registry hive. |
| Several ``bToggle*`` policies use inverted registry values (DWORD 0 = feature ON, DWORD 1 = feature OFF). The ADMX templates handle this so that the Group Policy **Enabled**/**Disabled** states match the FriendlyName intent, but raw registry checks may look counterintuitive. |
| Adobe ARM (the background update service) is always a 32-bit process and writes to `SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Adobe\Adobe ARM\...`, even on x64 deployments. |
| User-scope policies are marked `class="User"` so they appear only under *User Configuration*, not *Computer Configuration*. |

|----------|----------|:------:|:-------:|
| Cloud & Connectors | Cloud storage connectors (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive), Document Cloud services, preferences sync, generative AI, and sign-in controls. | 13 | 13 |
| Context, Tools & Search | UI toolbars, context menus, search features, Modern Viewer, tool shortcuts, and editing mode settings. | 12 | 21 |
| Documents, Editing & Accessibility | PDF creation, editing, form handling, accessibility tagging, and document conversion controls. | 4 | 11 |
| Microsoft Purview (MIP) | Machine-level FeatureLockDown policies for Microsoft Purview Information Protection: MIP labelling lockdown, save-time policy checks, sovereign cloud selection, browser auth, double key encryption, and OS auth prompt control. | 6 | 6 |
| Security: Execution & Protection | Sandbox modes (Protected Mode, AppContainer, Protected View), enhanced security, Flash content, and dangerous action blocking. | 16 | 16 |
| Security: Trust & Permissions | Digital signatures, trusted locations, certificate trust, security handlers, and URL access policies. | 19 | 20 |
| Sharing & Features | Adobe Sign, Send & Track, shared reviews, SharePoint/Office 365 integration, WebMail configuration, Acrobat.com file storage, and cloud signature storage. | 20 | 22 |

| Upsell | Upgrade prompts, trial purchase dialogs, promotional campaigns, App Center, and purchasable tool visibility. | 5 | 7 |

Counts above are machine-scope only — see [Reader DC Settings](reader-settings.md) and [Acrobat DC Settings](acrobat-settings.md) for the full per-policy lists. User-scope policies (501 total) ship in the same file but are not broken out by category here.

The **Browser Extension** category (12 policies for the Chrome/Edge Acrobat extension) isn't split by Reader/Acrobat — the extension is the same regardless of which desktop product is installed. See [Browser Extension Settings](browser-extension.md) for the full list.

## Deployment

### Intune

1. *Devices → Configuration → + Create → Import ADMX* — upload `AdobeDC.admx`, then `AdobeDC.adml` for `en-US`.
2. Create configuration profiles using *Administrative Templates*:
   - Computer Configuration policies → *Devices → Configuration → + Create → Templates → Administrative Templates*
   - User Configuration policies → *Users → Configuration → + Create → Templates → Administrative Templates*

### Group Policy (GPMC / gpedit.msc)

Copy `AdobeDC.admx` and `en-US/AdobeDC.adml` to your Central Store or local policy folder:

```
C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions\AdobeDC.admx
C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions\en-US\AdobeDC.adml
```

Policies appear under:
- *Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Adobe → Adobe Acrobat DC*
- *User Configuration → Administrative Templates → Adobe → Adobe Acrobat DC (User)*
