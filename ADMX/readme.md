# AdobeDC ADMX - Combined Machine + User

**Current version: v3.5** (22 July 2026). Full version history: [Changelog (Combined)](../Documentation/changelog.md).

**Current production release.** Supersedes the separate machine template (v2.21) and user template ([Adobe-DC-User-ADMX v1.10](https://github.com/systmworks/Adobe-DC-User-ADMX)) for new Group Policy and Intune deployments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Stable upgrade path (v3.4+).** From v3.4 onward, releases are **additive-only** except where a changelog entry documents a one-time control-type correction. Re-uploading `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML preserves existing Intune/GPO bindings for all other settings. Deleting the imported ADMX in Intune before re-upload is still required (platform limitation for custom ADMX). The frozen policy set is recorded in `Documentation/data/policy-baseline.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading from combined v3.4 to v3.5** keeps the same namespace and policy `name` attributes for all v3.4 settings. Re-upload `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML. **2** settings change control type and require one-time re-selection: **`tauthor`** (User, Toggle -> Text) and **`iLogLevel`** (Device, Toggle -> Enum). All other bindings are preserved. See [v3.5 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v35---22-july-2026).

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change when migrating from v2.x or User ADMX v1.x.** Combined v3.0+ uses namespace `Adobe.Policies.AdobeDC` and a re-organised policy tree. **Intune ADMX policy backups / exports taken against v2.x (or the separate User ADMX v1.x) will not import** - the `definitionId` GUIDs and category paths no longer match. To migrate an existing v2.x export, run [`Helper_Scripts/Convert-AdobeDcIntuneExportToCombinedV3.ps1`](../Helper_Scripts/Convert-AdobeDcIntuneExportToCombinedV3.ps1) to convert it to the combined layout before re-importing. See [Migrating from v2.21 + User v1.10](#migrating-from-v221--user-v110).

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading from combined v3.3 to v3.4** keeps the same namespace and policy `name` attributes for all v3.3 settings. Re-upload `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML. This was the **final classification pass**: **2** user toggles become enum dropdowns (`iAccessColorPolicy`, `iPageLayout`), and **17** unique user text prefs were added (**30** new ADMX entries across Acrobat+Reader) - re-select only those affected settings. See [v3.4 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v34---20-july-2026).

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading from combined v3.2 to v3.3** keeps the same namespace and policy `name` attributes. Re-upload `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML. **5** new user text policies, enum/numeric control fixes, and **8** app-internal toggles removed - re-select affected User settings in Intune/GPO after re-upload. See [v3.3 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v33---20-july-2026).

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading from combined v3.1 to v3.2** keeps the same namespace and policy `name` attributes. Re-upload `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML. **40 user-scope policies** change from toggles to enum dropdowns or numeric spinners - re-select those settings in Intune/GPO after re-upload. **Built-in Attachment Permissions List** (`tBuiltInPermList`) is **removed** (REG_BINARY; ADMX cannot author it). See [v3.2 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v32---20-july-2026).

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading from combined v3.0 to v3.1** is not import-breaking (same namespace and policy `name` attributes). Re-upload `AdobeDC.admx` + ADML. The v3.1 release corrects **Usage Measurement (legacy)** (`bUsageMeasurement`) polarity - see [v3.1 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v31---20-july-2026).

## What is in the combined template

| Area | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Packaging** | Single `AdobeDC.admx`/ADML pair for **Computer + User** configuration under one namespace |
| **Policy inventory** | **831** policies — **306** machine + **525** user (ADMX `<policy>` entries; see note below) |
| **Namespace** | `Adobe.Policies.AdobeDC` (replaces separate `Adobe.Policies.Adobe_User` user namespace) |
| **Computer tree** | **Adobe DC** → **Acrobat & Reader DC** / **Reader DC (32-bit)** / **Non-Policy Settings** / **Web Browser Extension** |
| **User tree** | **Adobe DC** → **Acrobat DC** / **Reader DC** |
| **OS requirement** | **64-bit Windows (x64) only.** The 32-bit application policies (Reader DC 32-bit, Acrobat DC 32-bit) configure 32-bit Adobe products running on a 64-bit OS — they rely on the `WOW6432Node` registry hive, which only exists on 64-bit Windows. Genuine 32-bit Windows is not supported. |
| **De-duplication** | `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies` settings emit once per product hive (no redundant `WOW6432Node\Policies` copies) |
| **Sources** | Device v2.21 + User v1.10 + Browser Extension schema.json |

**Policy count note:** **831** is the number of configurable policy entries in the ADMX (what Intune and GPMC show). **306** machine includes architecture-specific non-policy settings emitted separately for x64 and x86, plus 12 Web Browser Extension policies (Chrome + Edge). There are **155** unique machine settings in the source reference (**117** apply to both Reader and Acrobat; `tBuiltInPermList` is excluded as REG_BINARY). Product-scoped tables in [Documentation](../README.md) list user and machine settings because shared settings appear under each product.

### Built-in Attachment Permissions List (`tBuiltInPermList`)

This is the **only** REG_BINARY setting in the template. ADMX/ADML has **no binary element type**, so it cannot be authored via Group Policy or Intune ADMX upload. Combined v3.1 incorrectly used a text box (REG_SZ); v3.2 removed the policy.

Deploy the attachment allow/block list using [`Helper_Scripts/Set-AdobeBuiltInPermList.ps1`](../Helper_Scripts/Set-AdobeBuiltInPermList.ps1) (**`-ImportHex`** from `-ExportHex` is the trusted path; `-PermList` is best-effort), Group Policy Preferences registry items, or Intune custom OMA-URI with bytes captured from Acrobat Trust Manager.

### Migrating from v2.21 + User v1.10

Because the initial combined release (v3.0) is a breaking change (see the warning above), existing Intune ADMX policy exports/backups cannot be re-imported as-is. Convert them first:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Convert any v2.x Intune export/backup JSON with [`Helper_Scripts/Convert-AdobeDcIntuneExportToCombinedV3.ps1`](../Helper_Scripts/Convert-AdobeDcIntuneExportToCombinedV3.ps1) - it remaps category paths, de-duplicates redundant Policies-branch entries, and clears stale `definitionId` GUIDs (outputs `*_combined-v3.json`) |
| 2 | Remove existing `Adobe.Policies.AdobeDC` **and** `Adobe.Policies.Adobe_User` ADMX imports from Intune (wait 2-5 minutes after deletion) |
| 3 | Upload `AdobeDC.admx` and `en-US/AdobeDC.adml` from this folder |
| 4 | Import the converted `*_combined-v3.json` and re-bind / re-assign the policy settings |

If you migrated Intune exports from v2.19, Reader-only x64 upsell settings already map to Unified x64 - they will bind after uploading this ADMX.

## Files

| File | Scope | Policies |
|------|-------|----------|
| `AdobeDC.admx` + `en-US/AdobeDC.adml` | Machine + User | **831** (306 machine + 525 user) |

*306 machine = ADMX policy entries (includes 12 Web Browser Extension policies); 155 unique machine settings from Adobe PrefRef; product-scoped reference tables total 124 Reader + 170 Acrobat.*

Published policy reference tables: [Documentation](../README.md).

## Namespace

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Prefix | `AdobeDC` |
| Namespace URI | `Adobe.Policies.AdobeDC` |
| ADMX / ADML `revision` | 3.4 |
| `minRequiredRevision` (`resources`) | 3.4 |

## Intune upload

1. **Remove** any existing ADMX entry for `Adobe.Policies.AdobeDC` and `Adobe.Policies.Adobe_User` before uploading - including failed or stuck imports.
2. Wait 2-5 minutes after deletion.
3. Upload `AdobeDC.admx` and `en-US/AdobeDC.adml` together.
4. Assign machine settings to a **device group**; assign user settings to a **user group** (or combine both in one profile - scope is determined by each policy's `class` attribute).
5. After upgrading to v3.4, re-select **User** policies that changed in the final classification pass (`iAccessColorPolicy`, `iPageLayout`, and any newly added text policies - see [v3.4 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v34---20-july-2026)). After upgrading to v3.3, re-select User policies that changed (new text policies, enum/numeric fixes, removed app-internal toggles - see [v3.3 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v33---20-july-2026)). After upgrading to v3.2, re-select toggle->enum/numeric User policies (see [v3.2 changelog](../Documentation/changelog.md#v32---20-july-2026)). After upgrading from v3.0 to v3.1, re-verify **Usage Measurement (legacy)** if configured - **Disabled** now correctly writes telemetry **off** (DWORD 0).

## Group Policy

Copy `AdobeDC.admx` to `%SystemRoot%\PolicyDefinitions` and `AdobeDC.adml` to `%SystemRoot%\PolicyDefinitions\en-US`, then run `gpupdate /force`. Machine policies appear under **Computer Configuration**; user policies under **User Configuration**.
